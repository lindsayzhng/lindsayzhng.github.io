                            I'm currently studying Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo and I'm in my 3A term.
                            I'm a mobile developer but am excited to expand my horizons and explore owership in other areas of development.
                            If you're curious about my roles, just take a look at my LinkedIn! I don't think I need to explain much here.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            At my core, I value the people I work with, the impact of my development in communities I care about, and opportunities of growth and learning. 
                        </p>

                            I spent a lot of time so far in my degree trying to figure out my motivations for this program, the courses I take, and this career path.
                            And I realized that it really just comes down to people. It's the people I build with and the people I build for that motivate me. Navigating
                            this industry has always been frustrating for me, so I've really started to consider my intentions for what I do, instead of chasing whatever I think I should have.
                            I'm excited (and a bit terrified) to see where the rest of my degree takes me. Feel free to follow along my journey :)
